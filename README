NAME
    listing - C++ / Perl to LaTeX converter

SYNOPSIS
    listing *options* *filenames*

    where *filenames* is a sequence of C++ or Perl files (mixing allowed).

DESCRIPTION
    listing converts the files to a single LaTeX file listing.tex and runs latex, dvips and psnup on it.
    The results are a DVI file listing.dvi, a Postscript file listing1.ps (1 page/sheet), and a Postscript
    file listing.ps (2 pages/sheet).

    o       Keywords, C++ preprocessor commands, strings and comments are typeset in different fonts.

    o       Font size varies with nesting level ({...}).

    o       LaTeX verbatim comments in the styles /*tex...*/, //tex..., //\section... (resp for Perl #tex...
            etc) allow you to embed pictures and formulas in your comments.

    o       A table of contents (TOC) is produced.

    o       Identifiers can be collected in an index. (option --index) For the first occurrence of each
            identifier, a \label- command can be generated, so you can use \pageref in your LaTeX comments
            to refer to definitions. (option --references)

    o       Perl POD inline documentation is automatically run through pod2latex and included in the resulting
            LaTeX file.

OPTIONS
            listing is highly configurable, taking options from the command line as well as the
            environment variable LISTING. Valid options are listed in the following. For each option, both
            the short and long form are given.

    -v --version
            prints the version number and exits.

    -b --begin <header>
            includes the file <header> at the place where otherwise the LaTeX-command \begin{document}
            would stand. By default, if a file named begin.tex exists in the current working directory, it
            is included in that place, otherwise just the \begin{document} statement is produced.

    -l --listing <base>
            uses the filenames <base>.tex, <base>.dvi etc instead of listing.tex, listing.dvi etc. as
            output file names.

    -st --styles <stylefiles>
            uses the LaTeX2e style files <stylefiles> in the \documentclass statement as "options". The
            files must be comma-separated (but no spaces!). Default is 'fleqn,twoside'.

    -pa --packages <packagefiles>
            includes the LaTeX packages <packagefiles> by \usepackage statements. The files must be comma-
            separated (but no spaces!). Default is 'a4'. The package makeidx is always appended to the
            list unless the option --noindex is given, and the package psfig is always prepended to the
            list unless --nopsfig is given.

    --print <prt>
            causes listing to pipe the resulting file (1 page/sheet) to the print command <prt>. This
            option implies --latex, --noxdvi, and --quiet. A useful print command <prt> looks like "lpr -
            Plp".

    --print2 <prt>
            causes listing to pipe the resulting file (2 pages/sheet) to the print command <prt>. This
            option implies --latex, --noxdvi, and --quiet. A useful print command <prt> looks like "lpr -
            Plp".

    What follows is a list of options that can be set or unset. You can unset an option by prefixing it
    with a 'no' (e.g., --nolatex). This is particularly useful with options that are set by default.

    -q --quiet
            causes listing not to list the conversions going on. Also, the LaTeX/dvips/xdvi/psnup output
            and stderr is piped to /dev/null. Off by default.

    -l --latex
            causes listing to call latex/dvips/psnup after it has finished the conversion process. On by
            default.

    -x --xdvi
            causes listing to call xdvi after it has finished running latex. Implies --latex if set. Off
            by default.

    -ps --psfig
            puts a "psfig" in front of the style file list. This enables use of the \psfig command in your
            LaTeX-comments. On by default.

    -i --index
            causes listing to produce an index of words found in the source. Implies option --references.
            Off by default.

    -t --toc
            causes listing to produce a table of contents, which is however empty unless you set option --
            sections or write embedded LaTeX statements such as //\section{...} to generate entries. On by
            default.

    -sy --symbols
            causes listing to typeset certain special symbols (like Greek letters) in LaTeX's symbol font.
            On by default.

    -sm --smallfonts
            causes listing to use a smaller font set. On by default.

    -co --color
            causes listing to do syntax highlighting by LaTeX colors. Try it - it's cool! But since not
            everybody has a color printer: off by default.

    -se --sections
            produces a \section-command at the top of each file in the listing. You can have the same
            effect by putting a #\section{...}-like comment on the first line of each file. Off by default
            to encourage you to play around with LaTeX comments.

    -fo --formfeeds
            includes a \clearpage-command between files, so each file will start on a new page. On by
            default.

    -r --references
            produces a \label-command on every first occurence of an identifier, so you can use \pageref
            to refer to the page where an identifier is first declared. Off by default.

    -pre --preservepod
            preserves the original output of pod2latex for embedded POD (inline documentation). Otherwise,
            listing cuts off the pod2latex generated \section-command and downgrades subsequent
            \subsections and \subsubsections of POD documentation to \subsubsections and \paragraphs. This
            default should make your POD documentation look nicely embedded in the listing if you arrange
            each source file as a LaTeX \section, then inside the source code use \subsections. The POD
            then fills one \subsection, being arranged into \subsubsections and \paragraphs. Off by
            default.

ENVIRONMENT
    LISTING Default arguments. These are simply prepended to the command line argument on every call of
            listing.

FILES
    /usr/local/bin/listing
            The listing script.

    /usr/local/man/man1/listing.1
            The man page, generated from Perl's POD. You can produce the manpage by typing 'pod2man
            listing >listing.1'

BUGS
    listing has difficulties with very long source lines. Don't be bothered by overfull \hboxes. Most of
    the time, the result looks good, and if some (few) lines are cut off at the right margin, live with it
    or insert a linebreak.

    Certainly there are more bugs, since the Perl syntax is so hairy. But with reasonable sane source
    code, listing should do a good job.

    Getopt::Long to simplify option handling. I also thank Vadim Belman <voland@plab.ku.dk> for pointing
    out a bug, and Mathias Weber <mweber@atlas.de> for useful hints regarding POD.

    Piotr Klaban <makler@man.torun.pl> added the --smallfonts option as well as the cool --color option.
